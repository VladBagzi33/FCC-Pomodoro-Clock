# FCC-Pomodoro-Clock
React App
This is Pomodoro Clock project from freeCodeCamp, it's part of the certification projects for Front End Development Libraries.
I choose to do it by using React and Bootstrap.
This project was not made according to the instructions of the freeCodeCamp and does not pass their validation tests.
breakTime file is downloaded as mp3 beep sound.
